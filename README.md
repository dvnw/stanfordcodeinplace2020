# stanfordcodeinplace2020

The Stanford Code in Place Program 2020 taught us the fundamentals of computer programming. The lessons and different assignments were very challenging but fun. We used the Python programming language throughout the program. Amazing global learning experience at the time of COVID-19 outbreak thanks to all the volunteers (professors Piech and Mehran, staff, instructors, etc) from Stanford University. Thank you very much. Stay safe.
